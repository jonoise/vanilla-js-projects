# Background changer.

On this project i did elaborated a dynamic background changer. It was very fun to build, specially the navbar icon color changes. The idea of the project was taken from [John Smilga](https://www.johnsmilga.com/).

### Specifics:

* The colors prompts in the middle of the screen.
* Always a different color. Never a color will be taken twice in a row.
* You can choose between 3 different ways to pick a color.
* The project has a navbar. (It dances :D check it out!).
* It was necessary to use the forEach high-order function. 
* Also the MATH module to generate random values.
* And the queerySelectorAll for the navbar dancing letters.
